# Build to production

#### 1. `yarn build`

- using yarn
```shell
$ yarn build
```

- using npm
```shell
$ npm run build
```


#### 2. The result to the previous command will be on the build folder


NOTES: 
- We can remove the map.js files because they are only used for debug proposes.


#### 3. Bootstrap the app

Install the serve globally in your machine to serve the generated static files.

The build folder is ready to be deployed.
You may serve it with a static server:

Find out more about deployment here:

- using yarn

```shell
$yarn global add serve
$ serve -s build
```

- using npm
```shell
$ npm -i -g serve
$ serve -s build
```

#### 4. we can configure an environment variable to not generate the map.js files on the build

1. create a .env file on root folder with the content:
```
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
```
