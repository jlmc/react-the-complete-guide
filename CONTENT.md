## JavaScript - Refresher

#### let & const

- Use `let` if you want to create a variable that really is variable
- Use `const` if you plan on creating a constant value
- Avoid to create `var` variables


#### Arrow Functions

```
const myFnc () => {

}
```

- No more issue with `this` keyword

#### Export & Imports (Modules)

- person.js
```
const person = {

  name: 'Max'

}
export default person
```

- utility.js
```
export const clean = () => { ... }

export const baseData = 10;
```

- app.js

```
import person from './person.js'
import prs from './person.js'
```
  - we can choise witch name we want
  - note  that the file have default export

```
import { baseData } from './utility.js'
import { clean } from './utility.js'
```


- for compatibility reasons
```
import {smts as Smth} from './utility.js'

import * as bundled from './utility.js'
```

#### Spread & Rest Operators

```
const newArray = [ ...oldArray, 1,2 ]
const new Object = { ...oldObject, newProp:5 }
```

#### Destructuring

```
const numbers = [1,2,3];

[num1, num2] = numbers;
console.log(num1, num2); // 1 2


[num1, , num3] = numbers
console.log(num1, num2); // 1 3
```

Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd react-complete-guide
  npm start

Happy hacking!
